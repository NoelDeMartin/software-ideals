    <h1>Software Ideals</h1>
    <p>
        This is the result of using various Vibe Coding tools to generate a TODO application following my software ideals.

    <p>Here's the prompt I used:</p>
    <blockquote>
        Create a Todo application that is architected as a local-first Progressive Web App. The core philosophy of this
        app is that it must be fully usable upon visiting, requiring no internet connection and no user account to
        create and manage tasks. To achieve this, the underlying state management should rely on Conflict-free
        Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), ensuring that all data is persisted locally in the browser first.
        <br />
        <br />
        Crucially, I want the internal data model to be structured using RDF standards. Instead of storing simple JSON
        objects, the application should maintain a semantic knowledge graph of the user's tasks.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the synchronization strategy, design the system so that users remain anonymous by default. However, provide
        a way for users to log in where they can input a URL of a self-hosted backend or sync engine. Once this URL is
        provided, the local CRDT state should synchronize with that server, allowing the user to back up their data and
        share their task graph across multiple devices.
        <br />
        <br />
        Other than this configuration, the user interface should only support two actions: adding a new task and
        toggling its completion status with a checkbox.
